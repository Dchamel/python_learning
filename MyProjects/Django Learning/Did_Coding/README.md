## Getting started

First you will need to clone down the first module.

1) Create a new directory on your local machine. I have called mine django_course. This is your 'root directory'.

2) Open a terminal and cd into the root directory.

3) You can now clone the first module. You can do this a few different ways. I use SSH...

```
#option 1 - SSH
git clone --branch module_1 git@github.com:bobby-didcoding/django_course.git .

#option 2 - Github CLI
gh repo clone bobby-didcoding/django_course .
git checkout module_1

#option 3 - HTTPS
git clone --branch module_1 https://github.com/bobby-didcoding/django_course.git .
```

## Following along

Each module has a walk through video. All videos can be found in
my [Django 4.0 tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5VlxT4gkOFCmtb_BYtZuH5pki_S2AphR) playlist.

Please open /steps/module_1 to begin.
