# Django course - Module 1

This is my Django course. I hope you like it.

> These notes follow on from the README.md getting started instructions.

## Current root directory

Your root directory should look like the following.

```
django_course\  <--This is the root directory
    media\
        ...
    steps\
        ...
    >.gitignore
    >README.md
```

If in doubt, run the following git commands:

```
git checkout module_1
git pull origin module_1
```

## Steps/Commands

You should now have a directory called 'django_course' in your development directory. This will be known as your 'root
directory'.

In this module, we will be starting our project. To do this we need to create a virtual environment.
> Note: Python virtual env docs can be found [here](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html).

1) Virtual Environment - Open a terminal and use the following command to create a virtual environment.

```
python -m venv venv
```

Now activate the virtual environment with the following command.

```
# windows machine
venv\Scripts\activate.bat

#mac/linux
source venv/bin/activate
```

You will know that your virtual environment is active when your terminal displays the following:

```
(venv) path\to\project\django_course>
```

2) Packages and requirements - Our project will rely on a whole bunch of 3rd party packages (requirements) to function.
   We will be using a Python package manager to install packages throughout this course.
   The first and most import package is, of course, Django! The following command will install Django into our virtual
   environment.

```
pip install django
```

We need a file to store a list of project requirements. This will help when recreating the project in different
environments. Use the following command to create a file called requirements.txt.

```
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

3) Django - You can now go ahead and start a new Django project. Installing Django has given you access to a handy '
   startproject' command. Use the following command to start our new project.

```
django-admin startproject django_course .
```

## New Root directory

> Note: If all went well, your root directory should now look like this

```
django_course\  <--This is the root directory
    django_course\
        >__init__.py
        >asgi.py
        >settings.py
        >urls.py
        >wsgi.py
    media\
        ...
    steps\
        ...
    venv\
        include\
        Lib\
        Scripts\
    >.gitignore
    >manage.py
    >README.md
    >requirements.txt
```
